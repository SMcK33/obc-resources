# OBC Resources
## Resource papers and checklists
The various handouts and reference papers that are available through the OBC can be presented in a more user-friendly format. OBC visitors who prefer to work with their own collection of international relocation resources can benefit from cloning the repository to make their own notations and additions. 

## Naming protocol
Each resource (i.e., page) includes the following characteristics:
- Title
- Subtitle
- Summary
- Category Tag(s)
- Content
- Related resources
- OBC contact information
